This guide refers to the BitBox02 device password which you need to enter each time you want to unlock your BitBox02. It does not refer to the [optional passphrase]({% link bitbox02/advanced/passphrase.md %}).

It's only possible to change the device password by resetting your BitBox02 and restoring your wallet from your backup. During the restore process you can then choose a new device password.

Before you reset your BitBox02, it's **important** that you [verify your backup]({% link bitbox02/basics/managing-backups.md %}#verifying-a-backup).

Once you have successfully verified your wallet backup, you can [reset]({% link bitbox02/advanced/reset.md %}) your BitBox02 and [restore your wallet]({% link bitbox02/basics/import-wallet.md %}).
