The BitBox02 has ten capacitive touch sensors, five on each side in order to track a three different gestures:
- Tap: with one finger to select something such as a character during password entry.
- Hold: with thumb and index finger on both sides of the BitBox02 in order to confirm an action such as signing a transaction.
- Scroll: with one finger to scroll horizontally for example when displaying a Bitcoin address on the BitBox02.

Capacitive touch sensors work by measuring the conductivity of it's surroundings. By doing that in multiple areas it's possible to calculate the position of your finger.

That however means that the sensors can be disturbed by other conductive items in the environment.

Here are some examples of what could be interfering with the touch sensors of your BitBox02 thereby making it impossible to calculate the location of your finger:
- Placing the BitBox02 on a metal table
- Placing the BitBox02 on your leg

Please avoid any such environments that could be interfering with the capacitive touch sensors and try again.
