Normal off-the-shelf "SDHC" microSD cards can be used with your BitBox. (MicroSD cards of type "SDXC" will not work.)

The capacity of the microSD card does not matter, the backup file is very small so just get the lowest capacity available.

We recommend to choose microSD cards from a quality brand such as Sandisk.

If not done by default, you should be format it using MS-DOS (FAT) or vFAT.
