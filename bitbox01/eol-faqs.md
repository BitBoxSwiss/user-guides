# BitBox01 end-of-sale/life FAQs

As of 12 November 2019, the BitBox01 is no longer available for purchase. If you are a BitBox01 owner, please read through the FAQs below. If you have a question that you don’t find answered below, then please
{% include contact-no-email.html %}



### Why is BitBox01 no longer being sold?

The BitBox01 started development in 2014 and was released in 2016. Four years later, the industry has matured and changed significantly. When it comes to security, we believe users are best served with the most up-to-date products. The BitBox01 is superseded by the BitBox02.

### Can I continue to use my BitBox01?

Yes. We will continue to support the BitBox01 in our app and through <a href="mailto:support@shiftcrypto.ch">support@shiftcrypto.ch</a> for the foreseeable future. To avoid unnecessary hassle after the end of support date, we recommend moving over to a BitBox02 before November 2020.

To export your private key from the BitBox01 microSD card backup directly, please use our [backup center tool](https://guides.shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox01/other/backup-center/).


### Will my coins still be safe?

Yes. Your coins will still be stored on the BitBox01. The BitBox01 will continue to work and you will always be able to recover and transfer your funds regardless of the end of support date. However, after November 2020, it may be less convenient to move funds off the BitBox01. We recommend moving your funds to a BitBox02 or another wallet before then.

### What does EOL (end-of-life) mean?

EOL (end-of-life) for the BitBox01 means that we will stop actively releasing updates for the BitBox01 after November 2020, but may continue to do so if circumstances allow. EOL also means that the lifetime warranty terminates after this date.


### I’m a BitBox01 owner, do I get a discount on a BitBox02?

Yes. We’re offering all BitBox01 customers a loyalty discount to move over to the BitBox02. The discount code will be available as an in-app notification included in the BitBoxApp (from version 4.15.0).
