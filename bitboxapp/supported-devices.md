Release notes and all files can be found [here](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-wallet-app/releases). Please make sure that you do not install a "Pre-release" unless you are explicitly trying to test a new version.

Unfortunately the BitBoxApp will not work properly on Chromebook as even with "Linux (beta)" enabled, other USB devices are not supported, see [here](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en).
